title: Humble Link Bundle May 2022 Edition
---

In the spirit of collecting internet things, I want to start creating link bundles to interesting (to me) content that I would like to share and save. If it makes sense, I will include both archived and original versions to avoid dead links.  

### Tech Demos/Utilities
* <a href="https://spaceinbrowser.com/">https://spaceinbrowser.com/</a> I thought this was a super cool utility that shows the power of Webassembly. 

* <a href="https://www.linebyline.app/">https://www.linebyline.app</a> - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220505192045/https://www.linebyline.app/">(archived version)</a> A tool that can be used for memorizing speeches, scripture, etc

* <a href="https://archive.org/details/windows-xp-delta-edition">https://archive.org/details/windows-xp-delta-edition</a> This is a modified version of Windows XP that includes some of the goodies from older versions of Windows like the first version of Microsoft Media Player from Windows 95 and Windows Movie Maker. Of course Space Pinball is included. A valid product key is in the comments. 

### Language Learning
* <a href="https://www.languagereactor.com/catalogue/youtube#language=en">https://www.languagereactor.com/catalogue/youtube#language=en</a> This tool helps you to find native content in the language that you are trying to learn from Youtube. It also includes tools such as side-by-side translated subtitles to help with your learning. 

### Prose (catch all for writing/art):

* <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/hatethenews">http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/hatethenews</a> - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220510101036/http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/hatethenews">(archived version)</a> An article written by the now-passed Aaron Swartz who, among other things, was a co-founder of Reddit. It deals with how reading or watching the news actually doesn't really inform you on important topics but it just a time sink that will leave you feeling drained creatively and physically. 

* <a href="https://www.damninteresting.com/devouring-the-heart-of-portugal/">https://www.damninteresting.com/devouring-the-heart-of-portugal/</a> - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220525165344/https://www.damninteresting.com/devouring-the-heart-of-portugal/">(archived version)</a> This is a bizarre story about an incredible conman that almost took down the Portuguese banking system. 

* <a href="https://bjoernkarmann.dk/occlusion-grotesque">https://bjoernkarmann.dk/occlusion-grotesque</a> - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220524073512/https://bjoernkarmann.dk/occlusion-grotesque">(archived version)</a> An article about an interesting art installation that combines typography design with natural patterns found in nature.
