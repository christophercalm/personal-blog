title: Humble (Link) Bundle June 2022 Edition
---

In the spirit of collecting internet things, I want to start creating link bundles to interesting (to me) content that I would like to share and save. If it makes sense, I will include both archived and original versions to avoid dead links.  

This month I found a lot of very useful utilities. 

### Tech Demos/Utilities:

* <a href="https://github.com/44670/desmume-wasm">https://github.com/44670/desmume-wasm</a> - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220610212837/https://github.com/44670/desmume-wasm">(archived version)</a> This is a super cool WASM project that allows you to play DS games in the browser in full speed. I have tested this on an old iphone and I was super impressed. You can host it yourself or there is a link that you can play on the readme. Go check it out!

* <a href="https://github.com/borisdayma/dalle-mini">https://github.com/borisdayma/dalle-mini</a> - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220610213025/https://github.com/borisdayma/dalle-mini">(archived version)</a> This is a super cool AI image generation tool that will generate text from any text prompt. I tried a couple with some hilarious results. The link to a functioning demo is in the README once again. Below is an example that I tried.

* <a href="https://r-rpg.com/">https://r-rpg.com/</a>  - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220610213621/https://r-rpg.com/">(archived version)</a> This is a fun little game that shows the power of simple, fun programming without ads. It is a old school text adventure with a twist. You create your character as you go along and not before. 

* <a href="https://feather.wiki/">https://feather.wiki/</a>  - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220610214617/https://feather.wiki/">(archived version)</a> According to their website, "Feather Wiki is an app for creating personal non-linear notebooks, databases, and wikis that is entirely self-contained and runs in your browser." I am a big fan of useful programs that are small and have few dependencies. This tool can create a wiki and download it to your pc for you to view later offline or on another device. 


### Lifestyle:

* <a href="https://www.additudemag.com/stop-losing-things/">https://www.additudemag.com/stop-losing-things/</a> - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211217233419/https://www.additudemag.com/stop-losing-things/">(archived version)</a> This is an article written primarily ADHD people but that I have found very useful. It describes three practical ways to stop losing things. I had put a couple of these into practice and have already found them to be quite useful.

  This is a quote from one of my childhood heroes from Reading Rainbow and Star Trek, Levar Burton. I think that notifications and the way that big tech companies exploit their users is one of the biggest issues of the day. Sometimes it feels like there is no escaping the endless scrolling and notification filled world that we have created. However, there are small ways in which we can fight back without becoming tech fearing luddites.
