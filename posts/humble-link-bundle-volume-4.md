title: Humble Link Bundle Volume 4
---

Surfing the internet can be a very passive activity. I often find myself skimming an article or finding a useful resource that I lose or that becomes unavailable later on. Because of this I made this list to highlight some interesting tools, games, and articles that I have found. This month I found a lot of internet resources related to the arts and non technical writing. 

If it made sense, I have included an archived link via the WayBackMachine. This means that if a link becomes dead a couple of years down the road, most likely it will still be available on the WaybackMachine. If you are able to support this amazing resource, here is the link. [https://archive.org/donate](https://archive.org/donate)
