title: Cheat Sheet For If I'm Gone
---

The way that I run my home is inherently tied to technology and is therefore somewhat complex. Logins, investments, crypto, and warranties all need to be accessed in different ways. This complexity means that without someone that knows this information, getting things done in my absence would be extremely difficult if I was not able to help. Since in my family I handle most of these responsibilities, I decided to create a "cheat sheet" in case I was not able to attend to them for whatever reason. If I was incapacitated, the last thing I would want for my wife would be to track down logins, power of attorney, or investment information.

It is just a small, easily extensible template written in Markdown so that I can keep this information up to date and easily accessible. I plan on keeping multiple printed copies in different physical locations in order to further reduce the risk of losing this information in the case of a hurricane, theft, or fire. Below is the link. If you have any suggestions, feel free to comment or create a pull request. I hope that you find it useful!

For those less inclined to use Markdown, here is a link to download a version compatible with Google Docs or whatever office software you use.
