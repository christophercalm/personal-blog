Hey All,

Welcome to my blog. As I don't spend very much time on traditional social media and wanting to keep it that way, I decided to create this blog. I believe that a blog, more or less free from arbitrary decisions made by facebook mods, free from ads, and free from a platform that could go away or simply fade away like myspace, is a better medium for sharing technical and personal content.

The purpose that I see for this blog is to document personal stories, stuff related to hobbies, and technical information that I find interesting or beneficial. Expect stories on my new home town, technical tutorials, and anything else I want to post!
