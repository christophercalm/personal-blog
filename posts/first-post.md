Hey All,

Welcome to my blog. As I don't spend very much time on traditional social media and wanting to keep it that way, I decided to create this blog. 

The purpose that I see for this blog is to document personal stories, stuff related to hobbies, and technical information that I find interesting or beneficial. Expect stories on my new home town, technical tutorials, fishing information etc.
