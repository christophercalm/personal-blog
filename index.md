# Thoughts Collected

#### Hello,

And welcome to my micro-blog. I love old fashioned, text-based Web 1.0 websites that are simple and respect one's privacy. As part of this, I promise not to run intrusive analytics and to keep any kind of JS to a minimum. 

I have found that over the years, interesting ideas, links, and applications that I have collected usually become lost. My goal is to save these here as a reference for my future self. I hope that these ramblings will be of some use to you and me. 

As a personal introduction, my name is Chris and I am a full stack software developer based out of coastal Mississippi working for amshot. I am passionate about simple and low tech solutions to complicated problems as well as open source software. 

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-calmes-1ba03b14b/) or follow on [Github](https://github.com/christophercalm).
