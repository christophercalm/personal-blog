# Thoughts Collected

<img src="assets/images/header.jpg"></img>

#### Hello,

And welcome to my blog. I plan on using this as a springboard for creativity and personal development. 

My name is Chris and I am a full stack software developer newly based out of coastal Mississippi. 

I have found that over the years, interesting ideas, links, and applications that I have collected usually become lost. My goal is to save these here as a reference for my future self and for you! I hope that these ramblings will be of some use to you and me. 

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-calmes-1ba03b14b/) or follow on [Github](https://github.com/christophercalm).
